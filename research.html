    <h2>Competition and Privacy (Job Market Paper)</h2>
    <h3>Yifei Wang</h3>
    <p> The question of whether competition  enhances or impedes a firm's commitment to protecting consumer privacy has been debated in competition policy circles.  This paper studies how a shift in competition affects the nature and type of a firm's intrusion on consumers' privacy. I study this question in the context of Android app markets in China, and measure privacy by examining apps' permission requests. I investigate a 2017 regulation that reduced competition in censored app categories by prohibiting censorship-circumvention tools commonly used to access apps banned by the government. This regulation made banned apps less accessible and reduced competition faced by permitted apps in censored categories, but did not affect apps in uncensored categories. I use a synthetic differences-in-differences approach to examine the number of permissions requested by permitted apps in censored categories compared to apps in uncensored categories before and after the regulatory change. By analyzing over 300,000 historical app installation packages, I show that reducing competition led to a significant increase in the number of permissions requested by apps. Empirically, this increase in privacy-invasive behavior is due to treated apps' efforts to improve consumer engagement and monetize attention. It does not reflect additional use of data for ad-targeting or incorporating additional functions into their products.</p><br><br>
