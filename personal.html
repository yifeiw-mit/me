       <h1>Personal</h1>
        <p>I have been actively exploring new possibilityes to enrich my life. In my spare time, I enjoy literature, comedy, musicals, and singing. I picked up classical soprano singing during Covid and have been studying under the guidance of Dr. Jacob Zhou since 2020.  I also took the Stand-Up Comedy Crash Course at MIT (instructed by comedian Dan Crohn) and have been a fan of watching and perfoming comedy ever since. From 2019 to 2021, I held the position of Arts Chair at an MIT graduate residence. During this time, I took responsibility for organizing logo contests, photo contests, paint & drink nights, and arts coffee hours.</a></p>
