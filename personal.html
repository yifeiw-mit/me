       <h1>Personal</h1>
        <p>I have been actively exploring new possibilities to enrich my life. In my spare time, I enjoy literature, comedy, musicals, and singing. I picked up classical soprano singing during covid and have been studying under the guidance of Dr. Jacob Zhou since 2020.  I took a stand-up comedy course at MIT in winter 2023 (instructed by comedian Dan Crohn) and have been a fan of watching and performing comedy ever since. I was a member of MIT graduate student council's DC advocacy trip in May 2022 that advocated for graduate students rights on Capitol Hill. From 2019 to 2021, I held the position of Arts Chair at an MIT graduate residence. During this time, I took responsibility for organizing logo contests, photo contests, paint & drink nights, and arts coffee hours.</a></p>

       <p>I also like pickleball, table tennis, and swimming. I enjoy tennis too and have managed to be consistently terrible at it over the years. I have a sailing license from MIT and sail on the Charles river once every two years. I am impressively bad at directions.  </a></p>
